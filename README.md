An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5). After intensive market research, they’ve deduced that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.
In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for different segments of customers. 
This strategy has worked exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy on new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers.

I’ve performed k-means to help with the clustering of the new market.
